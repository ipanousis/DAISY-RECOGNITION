DAISY-RECOGNITION
=================

Master's project for 2012/13 is still in the proposal stage. 
The topic will involve dense (spatial+temporal) object recognition 
in video using DAISY (see DAISY-BP/ repository). This may be further
extended for more robustness as well as flexibility (multi-body,dynamic 
scene,tracking/prediction).
