DAISY-RECOGNITION
=================

The topic involves real-time dense (spatial+temporal) object recognition 
in video using DAISY (see DAISY-BP/ repository). This may be further
extended for more robustness as well as flexibility (multi-body,dynamic 
scene,tracking/prediction).

The project will, similarly to DAISY-BP, be developed for GPU using OpenCL.

The current stage is the design of the algorithm in MATLAB.

At this moment the rotational and scaling capability of the DAISY
descriptor is being thoroughly measured in order to determine
the granularity of the corresponding parameters required to test 
for during the matching to a video frame.
